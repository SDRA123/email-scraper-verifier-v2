# Email Verifier and Scraper - Full Stack Application

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack application for email verification and scraping with:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- FastAPI backend
- User authentication and management
- Database storage for Excel data as JSON
- Email verification and scraping functionality

## Architecture
- Frontend: React with TypeScript, Material-UI
- Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy
- Database: SQLite (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL)
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- File handling: Excel to JSON conversion

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow REST API conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices for user authentication
